Savinova;1995;; Murman's colonial seabirds;; St-Petersburg;;224;; Murman's colonial seabirds;; Barents Sea, Seabirds, Population dynamics, Food and feeding, Pollution, Parasites;In the 1960—1980s in the Barents Sea the forage base of seabirds was being affected by commercial fishery of hydrobionts. Depending on the fishery influence on fish flocks of either species, these changes played sometimes a positive role and provided an increase of food resources for some species (for example, kittiwakes). But in general even in the end of the 1960s, a stable negative tendency towards degradation of the seabird forage base arised in the Barents Sea. In the course of its rapid changes, sand eel became the principal food resource providing breeding of the most Murman seabirds. Due to these changes, the high-specialized fish-eating seabirds (guillemots and cormorants) got into serious troubles. Under existence of the traditional forage base they avoid any interspecific food competition owing to catching of different size groups of the same species and to searching them in different regions and at different depths. Different combinations of these opportunities permitted bird divers to use completely food resources around their colonies. Ichthyofauna changes resulted in transformation of trophic connections between seabirds and provoked increase of competition between them, whereas neutralization mechanisms were unsufficient under drastic decrease of fish resources. Finally, this process may result in forming of new food niches and some alterations of divers' number according to the current state of trophic conditions at the Murman.; Russian with English summ;

Breeding of 18 species (Anser erythropus, A. brachyrhynchus, Cygnus cygnus, Buteo lagopus lagopus, Lagopus mutus hyperboreus, Phalaropus lobatus, Philomachus pugnax, Calidris temminkii, Stercorarius skua, S. parasiticus, S. longicaudus, Larus argentatus, L. glaucoides, Asio flammeus, Anthus pratensis, Motacilla alba, Oenanthe oenanthe, Acanthis flammea hornemanni) and 2 subspecies (Gavia stellata squamata and Somateria mollissima borealis) was discovered for Novaya Zemlya for the first time. According to obtained data breeding is possible in Gavia immer, Branta bernicla hrota, Anas crecca, Polysticta stelleri, Haliaeetus albicilla, Falco columbarius, Calidris ferruginea, C. alba, Gallinago gallinago, Alca torda, Corvus cornix. The breeding of Gavia adamsii and Uria aalge was confirmed 50—70 years after the former records. The former breeding of else 11 species is proposed but need in additional information: Phalacrocorax carbo, Melanitta nigra, M. fusca, Mergus senator, M. merganser and may be Anas penelope (all up to beginning of XX century), and more early — Chen hyperboreus, Aquila chrysaetos, Falco rusticolus candicans, Pinguinus impennis, and Corvus corax. Several other species are recorded in Novaya Zemlya for the first time: Sula bassana, Chen caerulescens, Bucephala islandica, Accipiter gentilis, Pluvialis squatarola, P. fulva, P. apricaria, Calidris canutus, Limicola falcinellus, Larus heuglini and Motacilla citreola. Several presumably hybrids between Larus hyperboreus and L. marinus were observed and two specimens of such birds were collected. The general pattern of plumage of these birds is similar with typical Larus hyperboreus, the only difference was in presence of dark or black patches on 2th-4th outer primaries. This character is widely variable and in general is similar with ones of Larus glaucoides kumlieni. It is supposed that human influenced negatively on populations of several species (Cygnus bewickii, Somateria spectabilis and some other). The fauna of birds of Franz-Josef Land is poor, but the list of breeding species was enlarged in recent years by adding several new species: Branta leucopsis (data of K. De Korte), Anser brachyrhynchus, Stercorarius pomarinus, Larus glaucoides and, probably, Falco rusticolus and Fratercula arctica (our data).; Russian with English summ;

Peculiarities and reasons of the breeding distribution change in Lagopus lagopus are discussed. New data on breeding of Acanthis flammea and Gallinago gallinago were received.

Accordingly the Snowy Owls were breeding in 1995, but not in 1996. Their 1283 prey items were identified in both years, also nests of geese were mapped on the area of 50 km2 and geese breeding success was estimated. It was found that lemmings are the preferable food of Snowy Owls even when these prey animals had been declining or not abundant. In the latter situation birds were an alternative food of non-breeding Snowy Owls, and they formed 86% of the total prey mass taken, with mostly geese (goslings and molting adults) being consumed: over 72%. Three Anser geese species were breeding with the average density of 2.5 nests/km2. Hunting of three Snowy Owls, 4—5 Arctic Foxes (Alopex lagopus), and 15—20 Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus) in the study area resulted in almost zero breeding output of Anser geese. At the same time the Barnacle Geese (Branta leucopsis) were breeding with the density of an order of magnitude larger than Anser geese, however their egg loss was much lower, and their remains formed only 2.5% of the Snowy Owl food mass. This higher success of Barnacle Geese is due to their better choice of nest sites, better pronounced tendency to breed in colonies, and stronger flocking behaviour while with young coupled with more active defense behaviour, which often is communal. Probably this better adaptation of Barnacle Geese to predation is the main reason of quick recovering of the species population from the former depressed condition. The former natural insular breeding species range in Russian Arctic seems to be nearly restored now, while the process is on its early stage on the mainland. According to Pallas (1786) Barnacle Geese were common on Murman tundra and east of the White Sea in 1760s, being stored up in mass for winter by local people. A century later breeding of the species was completely destroyed at Murman. Barnacle Geese were also stored up for food by the last expedition of Willem Barents judging by bones collected in the expedition wintering place in the Icy Bay (Kalyakin, 1995).; Russian with English summ;

Totally, 19501 Common Eiders, 6956 King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) and 4297 Steller's Eiders (Polysticta stelleri) were counted. Most ducks (ca. 85%) were found in ice-covered waters along the Terskiy coast of the White Sea. Highly aggregated distribution pattern of seaducks was characteristic for this segment of the survey route with flocks exceeded 1000 birds. Along the East Murman segment ducks were distributed more dispersed. Lumbovskiy Bay was found to be important wintering site for the Steller's Eider. Demographic structure of the wintering populations of eiders and possible origin of wintering birds are discussed.

Twenty-three species of seabirds and waterfowl were recorded for the observation period, when the maximal water area was free of ice. The core species were seaducks with the dominance of the king eider and the black scoter. The overwhelming majority of the waterfowl occurs in the Pechora Sea while gathering and molting during migration. The native regional fauna of seabirds is poor and mainly represented by larids. In the northern part of the sea, there are significant food grounds for the Brunnich’s guillemots from colonies of the Novaya Zemlya. The avifauna in the Pechora Sea is characterized by high aggregations and their stable localization. The data on the density of the bird distribution in different parts of the area observed are given in tables. A map of mass concentrations of colonial seabirds, sea ducks, and swans in the Pechora Sea is given. Environmental factors affecting the formation of seasonal bird aggregations in the Pechora Sea are discussed, as well as the problems of marine bird conservation related to the development of oil extraction industry in the region.; Russian;

All data published to date considered, the total number of bird species ever registered on Kolguev Island runs to ninety five. Thirty three of them (Anser anser, Cygnus cygnus, Anas platyrhynchos, Anas crecca, Anas acuta, Bucephala clangula, Polysticta stelleri, Buteo lagopus, Haliaeetus albicilla, Falco rusticolus, Xenus cinereus, Calidris canutus, Lymnocryptes minimus, Gallinago gallinago, Fratercula arctica, Asia flammeus, Dendrocopos major, Riparia riparia, Hirundo rustica, Motacilla flava, Motacilla citreola, Sturnus vulgaris, Bombycilla garrulus, Corvus cornix, Corvus corax, Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Phylloscopus trochilus, Phylloscopus collybita, Turdus pilaris, Turdus iliacus, Luscinia svecica, Emberiza schoeniclus, Emberiza pusilla) were recorded there for the first time. Although most of these species fit the 'vagrant' category, breeding was confirmed for six of them (Anas acuta, Buteo lagopus, Corvus corax, Phylloscopus trochilus, Turdus iliacus, Luscinia svecica). In addition, breeding was confirmed for four species considered vagrant previously (Pluvialis apricaria, Tringa erythropus, Anthus pratensis, Acanthis flammea s.l.). Comparative analysis of the published and original data revealed expansion of the ranges of a whole group of species characteristic to the southern regions (Anas acuta, Gallinago gallinago, Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Phylloscopus trochilus, Turdus iliacus, Luscinia svecica and, possibly, Emberiza schoeniclus) to Kolguev Island. Changes in the quantitative proportion of the Anseriform species and their status in the area compared to the late 19th and early 20th centuries were revealed. First of all, colonization of the island tundras by the Barnacle Geese, abrupt increase in numbers of the White-fronted and Bean Geese in the Kolguev tundras and cessation of Brent Goose breeding on the island should be mentioned. Quantitative estimates of the bird numbers on the Kolguev Island unambiguously demonstrate the uniqueness of this island for preservation of biodiversity in the European sector of Arctic as a whole and particular value of Kolguev ecosystems for conservation and maintenance of the population numbers of the White-fronted, Bean, and Barnacle Geese as well as Dunlins and Grey Plovers. The number of nesting Dunlins reaches 175000 pairs, while their total number in the end of the breeding season exceeds 500000 individuals. The breeding grounds of the largest Barents Sea colony of the Barnacle Geese numbering more than 5000 pairs is located in the Peschanka River delta on Kolguev Island. The numbers and nesting density of the White-fronted Geese exceed any of these parameters known to date for the Palearctic. Despite the lack of representative data, the overall numbers of this species on Kolguev Island can be estimated at a few hundred thousand individuals, while the total world numbers of the White-fronted Goose population in the Western Palearctic are 1.5—1.7 million individuals (Wetlands International, 2002). At present, Kolguev Island is one of the regions of the highest breeding concentrations of the Willow Ptarmigans. The numbers of the Grey Plovers are also very high and, according to our tentative estimates, exceed 5000 pairs. In addition to the inland areas of the island, the coastal water areas located between Kolguev Island and the system of the Western and Eastern Ploskie Koshki islands is of great importance for the preservation and well-being of many waterfowl and marine bird species, the King Eiders, mergansers, skuas, and gulls in particular. This water area is considered one of the principal moulting and pre-migration grounds of the marine birds and waterfowl in the eastern part of the Barents Sea (Krasnov et al., 2002). This water area is of particular value in the autumn. Since the role of the territory of Kolguev Island in the Arctic biodiversity conservation is extremely great and the plans for industrial exploitation of the island, being associated with the explored oil and gas deposits, are very extensive, establishment of the complex protection of the ecosystems of Kolguev Island seems to be most urgent under present conditions.; Russian with English summ;

In total 30 species of birds were recorded including terrestrial ones occasionally observed at the coastline. The most abundant species were the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) and Steller’s Eider (Polysticta stelleri) among waterfowl with 11,188 and 4250 individuals counted, respectively, and the Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) among seabirds (8702 and 8483 individuals, respectively). Waterbird diversity was higher along the Terskiy coast (south Kola Peninsula) while numbers of seabirds were higher along the Murman Coast (north-east Kola Peninsula). Birds were distributed in accordance with different oceanographic and  trophic conditions in these two major segments of the surveyed area with waterfowl being linked with shallows adjoining lowland of the Terskiy coast, while piscivorous birds preferred Murman  waters rich of small young fishes.Comparison with our data obtained in mid-20th century has revealed long-term positive trend in the population of Steller’s Eider and stable population of the Common Eider in the study area in postbreeding period. New colonies of the Great Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) were found in eastern Kola Peninsula, which are in congruence with other observations of the species range expansion.; Russian;

The experimental researches showed that the most intensive changes in birds' organisms on a biochemical level occur from fourth to tenth day after infection.

However, most of these studies were made in bird colonies located on the Sem’ Ostrovov archipelago, as described in publications by a number of authors [1‐5]. Data on other large colonies of sea birds are still fragmentary and scarce, because ornithological observations and censuses have been performed rarely there [2]. At the same time, the size and species composition of the ornithofauna and the geographic location of colonies in the continental part of Murman make the results of studies in this region of considerable interest for understanding processes in bird populations of the southern Barents Sea. Therefore, we carried out regular studies in three largest colonies of sea birds on the Murman coast. The Gorodetskie Ptich’i Bazary colony is located on Cape Gorodetskii of the Rybachii Peninsula; this is the westernmost colony in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea. The colony of Dvorovaya Bay is located at the eastern boundary of the nesting area of black-legged kittiwakes on the Murman coast, and the Mys Krutik colony is on Cape Krutik in the center of the Kola Peninsula coast, at equal distances from the Gorodetskie Ptich’i Bazary colony and the colony of Dvorovaya Bay. The studies were performed from June to late July every year from 2000 to 2008. The data on the Gorodetskie Ptich’i Bazary colony for the years 2000 and 2002 were kindly provided by Yu.I. Goryaev. The main purposes of the study were estimation of the current state of the nesting sites of black-legged kittiwakes and guillemots, evaluation of the numbers of birds reproducing in them, analysis of the trophic conditions during the nesting period, and determination of the trends in bird development in these colonies. The census of nesting black-legged kittiwakes was performed by means of panoramic photographing of the colonies followed by analysis of the number of inhabited nests. This method of census minimizes the percentage of errors and provides the most accurate data on the number of nesting birds. The numbers of guillemots of both species were visually estimated by observing the colonies through field glasses. The numbers and species of the birds were recorded. The results have shown that the largest black-legged kittiwake colonies are located on the Rybachii Peninsula and in Dvorovaya Bay. The current number of birds of this species in each of these colonies is more than 25 000 pairs. Regarding the third colony (on Cape Krutik of the Kola coast), its current size no more than 3000 pairs (Table 1).";;

Examination of the samples revealed that the diet of this species consisted of eight groups of food objects, and was based on benthic invertebrates. Mollusks (100 %) and polychaetes (62.3 %) were found most frequently. Blue or common mussels (Mytilus edulis) were found in all samples, although this species is uncommon in the benthic community of the study area. Indeed, blue mussels comprised only 21.7 % of all food items found in the faeces. It is suggested that the proportion of polychaetes and crustaceans in the diet of King Eiders was underestimated because of the their greater digestibility. On the whole, the foraging strategy of King Eiders is assumed to be to feed on mollusks and polychaetes, the most numerous benthic groups in the study area. It is also assumed that commercial oil extraction in the area would negatively affect benthic food abundance and availability and, hence, result in a decrease in the abundance of the King Eider population.; Russian;

The observation site was situated on the Cape Zapadny Pechak in the southern part of the Bolshoy Solovetsky Island (64°57'24'' N, 35°44'10'' E). The count route 4 km long passed along the littoral zone, coastal meadows and crooked birch forest. Altogether 102 hîurs were spent at the observation site (4 hours a day) and 100 km (60 hours) were covered by en-route counts. In total about 61 000 birds (more than 32 000 during en-route counts and more than 28 000 at the observation site) of 106 species were observed (Table 1). They represented the orders of Gaviiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Charadriiformes, and Passeriformes. The most abundant species at the passage were the Dunlin and Arctic Tern. The prevailing direction was to the east along the southern coast of the Bolshoy Solovetsky Island. The minority of birds flew to the north along the western coast of the island. Very few species crossed the island straight on. The data obtained prove the significance of the southern part of the Bolshoy Solovetsky Island as the stîpover place during spring migration in the Dunlin. This territory is a part of the Solovetsky State History and Architecture Museum and Reserve and is included in the list of Important Bird Areas of Russia of international significance (Semashko et al., 2000). The current protection regime (as long as the hunting is prohibited) seems sufficient. Though, the significance of this region is to be taken to account in case of transportation of oil products through the adjoining water areas. The monitoring of the littoral zone and hydrobiological studies would be expedient.; Russian;

In conditions of shortage of the fish food in the sea, here is formed a large group of seagulls (Herring Gull makes the overwhelming majority). It constitutes a substantial proportion of the modern population of gulls of Murman (presumably 3000–4000 breeding pairs, 14000–20000 mature and immature individuals). On average for 4 years, the number of gulls of both species, periodically visiting the Murmansk rubbish dump during the summer season, defined by method of labeling with the re-registration, made up 16450 ± 1204 individuals. From 2008 to 2011, аccording to these records, the number of birds increased in about 3.2 times – from 8500 (± 904) to 27600 (± 1864) individuals. Herring and Great Black-backed Gulls nested in mixed colonies (ranging from 0.2 to 11 ha.) in most of the islands in the study area (a total of 42 islands ranging from 0.2 to 130 ha.). The population density made up respectively 37–100 and 1–2 pairs/ha. of the colony. The average clutch size of Herring Gulls on a permanent test area on the Shalim island was in 2009 2.88 ± 0.07, in 2010 – 2.90 ± 0.07, in 2011 – 2.80 ± 0.04 eggs. The difference in mass of the largest and smallest eggs for 3-egg clutches was on average 5.8 ± 0.44 g (n = 150), the average weight of eggs made up 93.0 ± 0.49 g (n = 220). Average daily weight gain of chicks of Herring Gull during 5–33 days was about 25 g (y = 24.85x +31251). Survival of chicks in 2009 and 2011 at 31st day was about 0.55 per pair (taking into account the possible errors – up to 1 chick per pair). The average body weight of mature females and males of Herring Gull (n = 46 and 45) was in July respectively 982 ± 10,5 g and 1211 ± 13,4. The basis of the diet of adult birds and their chicks were the waste.; Russian;

The reserved territory was significantly enlarged in 1967–1977 resulted in the increase of the number of all species. The common eider population had two peaks of the numbers (1967 and 1997). In 1960–1980, helminthiasis and disturbance of broods influenced the eider reproduction. Since the early 1990s, the predation during incubational periods was the main factor limiting the eider reproduction. After rising the number of populations of turnstone, oystercatcher, and common gull, there were relatively stable periods followed by a gradual decline in their numbers. In herring and great black-backed gulls, peaks in their numbers were immediately substituted for a sharp decline. After 1995, the number of nesting pairs in all these species became lower. Presently, the main factor that limits the reproduction success and determines the distribution of nest colonies in seabirds is predation. The main predators are brown bear and whitetailed sea eagle. In the period of increasing the populations of seabird, both species had minimal numbers. In the 1990s, their number quickly increased resulting from ceasing of hunt (bear) and efficient protection of the species (whitetailed sea eagle).; Russian;

Data of number and density of distribution of birds was collected during accounts from a vessel board in coastal waters of Murman, in Voronka and Gorlo of the White Sea. In total 32 species of seabirds and waterfowls were registered. A number of colonial seabirds, were common and reaching high number at Murman coast Shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), both Guillemot species (Uria spp.), Puffin (Fratercula arctica), didn't extend in waters of Voronka of the White Sea eastward from Svyatoi Nos Cape. The other species of colonial seabirds, such the Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) and Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) penetrate into the Voronka of the White Sea, but their number sharply decreased in comparison with number in coastal waters of Murman. Species were common in coastal waters of Murman (Razorbill (Alca torda), Arctic Skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea), sea ducks), were found either in the Barents Sea or in the northern part of the White Sea. Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus), Heuglini Gulls (Larus heuglini) and Long-tailed Skuas (Stercorarius longicaudus) were typical mainly in waters of Gorlo and adjacent Voronka areas. A sharp change in characteristics of pelagic ecosystems on a border between the Barents Sea and the White Sea defines feeding conditions for seabirds and first of all for colonial species of them. It resulted in considerable differences in species composition of avifauna and distributions of birds on the both sides from Svyatoi Nos Cape and points border between the Barents Sea and the White Sea easily distinguished at crossing onboard a vessel.; Russian;

Abondance and size of this seaduck determine its role in ecosystem of the White Sea. Food composition in different parts of the White Sea: in Kandalaksha Bay, in Onega Bay and in several areas of Terskiy coast was analyzed by methods of excrement examination in 2000-2006. Comparisons were made of food composition in winter and summer in Kandalaksha Bay. A variety of benthic organisms, also fish (cod Gadus morhua marisalbi and herring Clupea pallasii marisalbi) and insects in some cases were found in Common Eider food composition. Molluscs dominated food composition of this marine duck species. Different species of bivalves with blue mussels Mytilus edulis among them and gastropods sometimes dominated Common Eider food composition depending on study area. In some parts of the Kandalaksha Bay and in all study areas of Onega Bay and Terskiy coast, the importance of blue mussels was again low. This study showed the geographic variability of the Common Eider diet, some reasons of this variability is discussed. Feeding behavior of Common Eider is very flexible which allows effective foraging either on benthos or on moving objects such as fish. Under given conditions, a bird feeds on the most numerous of accessible food items. Large-scale geographical variations in Common Eider diet composition prevail over the seasonal and sexual trophic relations differences.; Russian;

Population and seasonal allocation of water birds;;;Among the Kola Bay avifauna is allocated a group of bird species, which is due to the presence of close links with the local marine ecosystem, designated as a group of aquatic birds (or water birds). Based on the materials of the Kola Bay ornithological surveys between 1999-2013 yrs. maps of seasonal distribution of these species of birds in the bay area, and through the peer reviews, based on the literary and historical data, was determined the average long-term abundance. Was shown that in the course of the annual cycle in the Kola Bay was found 28 species of water birds with a total population from 4,4 to 7 thousand individuals. These species, mostly the sea ducks, are distributed mostly in the shallow coastal zone, which is about 30% of the area. Assumed that the collection of all the data obtained can be used for a preliminary assessment of the potential vulnerability of the Kola Bay avifauna from oil pollution.; Russian;

Abundance and seasonal distribution of periwater birds;;;The species and quantitative composition of coastal birds (larines and sandpipers) and features of their behavior in Kola Bay of the Barents Sea are described following results of analysis of literary and archival data and obtained expert estimates. Cartographic material reflecting their distribution densities in the bay by seasons was created, that is necessary for assessing their potential vulnerability to oil pollution of various sites of the region. The paper shows that the quantity of background species of periwater birds associated with marine ecosystems of Kola Bay is finite throughout the annual cycle. This quantity for larines is minimal in winter (5 species) and is maximal in spring (7 species). For sandpipes it is minimal in autumn and winter (1 species) and is maximal in spring and summer (4 species). The total number of larines in Kola Bay varies from season to season and averages between 1 600 individuals in winter and 11 800 ones in summer. The total quantity of sandpipers during the annual cycle changes from 1 000 individuals in winter to 300-400 ones in other seasons. At that, as opposed to larines, the maximal abundance of sandpipers is registered exactly in winter when wintering purple sandpipers concentrate in the bay. It is established that larines and sandpipers show the greatest density of distribution in summer and autumn in the littoral, that makes this biotope especially vulnerable to oil pollution during this time.; Russian;

The present-day abundance was determined for both populations: since the 1950s, it was the highest in the 2000s for the entire period of ornithological monitoring in the region. Aerial survey from a helicopter is considered to be the only reliable method for estimation of the total population number. The best season for surveying the White Sea population is March–early April (wintering); the most favorable period for surveying the Murmansk population is August (postbreeding/molting). The population status of the common eider in the northern and eastern parts of the Barents Sea has not yet been evaluated. On Franz-Josef Land, the common eider is distributed sporadically, and its number was assessed using expert estimates. The current abundance of the common eider on Novaya Zemlya is unknown. Helicopter-based aerial survey performed in late summer during the postbreeding season is the only relevant method to obtain reliable estimates for the population of the common eider inhabiting Franz-Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya."; English;

The authors single out 23 of 54 species of the birds closely associated with the marine ecosystems as the most significant for the avifauna of the investigated area. A list of water (aquatic) and periwater (periaquatic) species of the birds is presented. The probabilities of contacts of birds of these two groups with oil or petroleum products if they are spilt are estimated (90 and 35% respectively). Such estimates are needed for calculating the vulnerability of the birds to oil pollution influence and for subsequent construction of integrated maps of the Kola Bay vulnerability.; Russian;

Among all of them, the thick-billed murre or Brünnich's guillemot, the northern fulmar, and the black-legged kittiwake comprised more than 90 % of birds of all species and were wide-spread and numerous across a vast water area. The little auk or dovekie was dominant (36 %) in the sea ice zone and adjacent waters.

The possibility of land areas migration (including the territory outside of the main area) of some population part of Murman kittiwakes is approved by the records of standard metal ringed and logger labeled birds. It was demonstrated that the number of returns from the Baltic, Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas regions, depending on the age of kittiwakes, can vary from 1.7 to 4.5 % of the total number of registered ringed birds. The hypothesis about flight paths formation and migration strategy changes of the kittiwakes in accordance with the development of marine lifestyle during the last glaciation degradation is discussed. Analysis of the whole information complex allows us to expand our understanding of migration behavior formation of the kittiwakes. Within the framework of this hypothesis, it is assumed that until the marine life-style of kittiwake has completely developed, along with other gull species, it could perform seasonal migration by the sides of river and lake systems and at least partially winter in the southern seas basins. The phenomenon of Murman kittiwakes occurrence in the Mediterranean, the Black and Caspian seas basins in the modern period is regarded as a rare but natural phenomenon. It is assumed that specific routes for “land” migration of kittiwakes, including those in the southern regions listed above, could be described in detail with the help of satellite sensors in the future.;;

The abundance, breeding success, and food spectrum were investigated. Colonial birds quite often suffer in pre- and nesting periods from a lack of basic prey, such as pelagic schooling fish. This results in significant interannual fluctuations in the number of breeding birds and affects negatively the size of the average clutch. A steady process of main colonies degradation and the emergence of small nesting groups is observed.; Russian;
